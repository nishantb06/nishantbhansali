Hi, after my extensive work on Content Moderation Systems at Sharechat, I consider myself a generalist who can train, finetune, deploy Deep Learning Models across different modalites (Vision, NLP, Audio) in scalable production environments. My everyday work has included everything from Microsoft Excel to Kubernetes and working together with folks from Product, Operation, Data Scientists and Engineers alike. With a base in Computer Vision, I have a thorough understanding of how to train/finetune LLM's and how to build RAG applications with them as well.


## ML Engineer @ Sharechat (June 2022 -> Present)
### Notable Projects 

#### ML Server optimisation for Moj Audio Livestream moderation
There is a need to check for NSFW content during Livestream on MOJ. For this we trained Wave2Vec2 models on 20 Second Audio Clips for different languages. These models were earlier deployed in an event driven architecture applications written in Python. 

Rewriting this application in Golang and leveraging Torchserve (Scripting the model + efficent process management) to expose the models through an API , helped us cut the cost of this deployment by 66%, yielding in savings of 6L rupees per month.

## Computer Vision and Image Processing Intern @ Sharechat (Jan 2022 -> May 2022)

- Implemented various research papers for Contrast Enhancement and Denoising like Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization and Non-Local Means denoising and other classical Image Processing algorithms

- Executed thorough benchmarking analyses on proprietary datasets,tech stack comprising C++, Python libraries including OpenCV and scikit-learn, along with other open-source repositories.

## Personal Projects
