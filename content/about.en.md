## Who am I?

Hi, my name is **Nishant Bhansali**. I'm working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at **Sharechat**,working remotely from Ahmedabad,India.
I have majorly worked on solving **Computer Vision** and **Digital Image Processing** based problems, ands thats where I would say my expertise lies. Be it recent transformer architectures or archaic Image processing algorithms, I have my my hands dirtied by almost everything vision based. My work at Sharechat has been around **Image Enhancement** and **Image Quality assessement**.

I love working on open source projects, having contributed to **Pytorch Lightning** and **Pytorch Ignite** in the past, I am deeply fascinated by deep learning systems also. Other than this I like to participate in **Kaggle Competitions** also as it forces me to stay up to date by current trends in the industry. Rapid experimentaion and deployig models in production are a few things that I am currently learning right now.

I am a huge sports buff. Played Basketball for roughly 10 years and currently exploring surfing and Kick-boxing!

## Why this blog?
This blog is just meant as a brain dump for the world to see. I am not going to refine the blogs here much as they are meant as a proof of work for myself over the years. Therefore if by any chance you find one of these blogs useful and would like to get in touch with me, please do so via twitter or mail!
Would love to debate if I get anything wrong here as well.

Thanks for spending your time on my blog!!
